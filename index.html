        <h2>Communities and Ethnic Affiliations</h2>
        <p>
          In Canada, multiple communities are involved in treaties, especially
          Indigenous groups. For example, the Treaty 1 area includes First
          Nations like the Anishinaabe, Cree, and Dakota people. These groups
          have different cultural backgrounds but share a common history in
          their relationship with the land.

        <h2>Historic Terms of the Treaty</h2>
        <p>
          Treaties often included important promises and details about land. In
          Treaty 1, for instance, the government promised certain benefits like
          education, health care, and reserves for the Indigenous communities.
          Families were given land, usually about 160 acres for every family of
          five. The treaties also promised hunting and fishing rights on
          traditional lands.

      <article id="treaty-differences">
        <h2>What Makes This Treaty Different</h2>
        <p>
          Treaty 1 is important because it was one of the first treaties signed
          in Canada. It set an example for future treaties and involved the
          government recognizing Indigenous rights in an agreement. Unlike some
          treaties that were later negotiated, Treaty 1 aimed to establish a
          relationship based on respect. Ensuring that these have been followed
          has often been problematic.

        <h2>Implementation Today</h2>
        <p>
          Today, Treaty 1 communities are working on applying the terms of the
          treaty. This includes creating urban reserves, like Kapyong Urban
          Reserve, which allows First Nations to develop land inside cities for
          economic purposes. Communities are also involved in businesses such as
          gas stations and cultural centers. Economic development is essential
          for these communities, helping to support their members and ensure a
          better future while honoring the treaty agreements.
