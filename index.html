          <h2>Communities and Ethnic Affiliations</h2>
          <p>
            In Canada, multiple communities are involved in treaties, especially
            <span style="color: green">Indigenous groups</span>. For example,
            the <span style="font-style: italic">Treaty 1</span> area includes
            <span style="font-weight: bold">First Nations</span> like the
            Anishinaabe, Cree, and Dakota people. These groups have different
            cultural backgrounds but share a common history in their
            relationship with the land.

          <h2>Historic Terms of the Treaty</h2>
          <p>
            Treaties often included important promises and details about land.
            In <span style="font-weight: bold">Treaty 1</span>, for instance,
            the government promised certain benefits like education, health
            care, and reserves for the
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Indigenous communities</span>.
            Families were given land, usually about 160 acres for every family
            of five. The treaties also promised hunting and fishing rights on
            traditional lands.

          <h2>What Makes This Treaty Different</h2>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Treaty 1</span> is important because
            it was one of the first treaties signed in Canada. It set an example
            for future treaties and involved the government recognizing
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Indigenous rights</span> in an
            agreement. Unlike some treaties that were later negotiated,
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Treaty 1</span> aimed to establish a
            relationship based on respect. Ensuring that these have been
            followed has often been problematic.

          <h2>Implementation Today</h2>
          <p>
            Today,
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Treaty 1 communities</span> are
            working on applying the terms of the treaty. This includes creating
            urban reserves, like Kapyong Urban Reserve, which allows
            <span style="font-weight: bold">First Nations</span> to develop land
            inside cities for economic purposes. Communities are also involved
            in businesses such as gas stations and cultural centers. Economic
            development is essential for these communities, helping to support
            their members and ensure a better future while honoring the treaty
            agreements.
