        <h2>Communities and Ethnic Affiliations</h2>
        <p>
          In Canada, multiple communities are involved in treaties, especially
          Indigenous groups. For example, the
          <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Treaty 1 </span> area
          includes First Nations like the Anishinaabe, Cree, and Dakota people.
          These groups have different cultural backgrounds but share a common
          history in their relationship with the land.

        <h2>Historic Terms of the Treaty</h2>
        <p>
          Treaties often included important promises and details about land. In
          <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Treaty 1</span>, for
          instance, the government promised certain benefits like education,
          health care, and reserves for the Indigenous communities. Families
          were given land, usually about 160 acres for every family of five. The
          treaties also promised hunting and fishing rights on traditional
          lands.

        <h2>What Makes This Treaty Different</h2>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue">Treaty 1</span> is
          important because it was one of the first treaties signed in Canada.
          It set an example for future treaties and involved the government
          recognizing Indigenous rights in an agreement. Unlike some treaties
          that were later negotiated,
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue">Treaty 1</span> aimed to
          establish a relationship based on respect. Ensuring that these have
          been followed has often been problematic.

        <h2>Implementation Today</h2>
        <p>
          Today,
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: blue">Treaty 1 </span>
          communities are working on applying the terms of the treaty. This
          includes creating urban reserves, like Kapyong Urban Reserve, which
          allows First Nations to develop land inside cities for economic
          purposes. Communities are also involved in businesses such as gas
          stations and cultural centers. Economic development is essential for
          these communities, helping to support their members and ensure a
          better future while honoring the treaty agreements.
